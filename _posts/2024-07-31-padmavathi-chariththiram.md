When the modern literature was introduced into the Tamil mileau, it was not short stories but novels that caught the eye and the hand of Tamil writers. There were three major novels written before the start of the 20th century -- Pratapa Mudhaliyar Chariththiram (பிரதாப முதலியார் சரித்திரம்) in 1879, Kamalambal Chariththiram (கமலாம்பாள் சரித்திரம்) in 1893, and Padmavathi Chariththiram (பத்மாவதி சரித்திரம்) in 1898, following the naming convention of English novels such as Jane Eyre: An Autobiography. 

Padmavathi Chariththiram was written by A. Madhavaiya, published in three parts with the third one unfinished. While the name of the novel mentions Padmavathi as the main character who is a female, it is actually Narayanan, the male, who can be considered the protagonist. The first part of the novel tells the childhood and teen years of Narayanan, the second part, his initial marriage life, and the final part starts describing the love life of his friend and widower, Gopalan. In an afternote by the author's son, the complications in Gopalan's second marriage would be resolved by the titular character Padmavathi but the author died before finishing the novel.

The author establishes the character, Narayanan, as noble and truthful in an unseemingly easy manner through his behavior in the courts where he refuses to lie to save his father from going to prison. We are introduced to various characters through Narayanan -- his friend, Gopalan, and his lover and wife, Padmavathi. Narayanan is the face of a new generation of the time who tries to get rid of old practices in the Indian society such as child marriage, women rights, and widow remarriage, through the modern English law and education. His decisions are influenced by the morals of both Tamil and English literature. He climbs the ropes from being in a poor family in a village to studying school in another village to moving to the city of Madras (Chennai) for higher education and job, all through education.
